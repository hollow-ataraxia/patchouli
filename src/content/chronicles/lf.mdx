## Why a terminal file manager?

There are many cases when we may need a terminal file manager.
Personally, I found them useful for those who use the terminal a lot and don't
want to open a GUI app just to pick a file or display the files tree.

Back when I start using Arch Linux, it was with [xmonad](https://xmonad.org/)
and URXVT(rxvt-unicode). Ranger was the file manager, the most people were
using. It still an excellent software, but I would rather use `lf` instead.

The reason of using `lf` over other tools it how simple it is, supports vim
keybindings and its functionalities can be extended by scripts.

## Configuration

`lf` would look into the user's config directory, `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/lf/lfrc`,
for the configuration file, but it can be set to a different file with the
`-config` flag.

```sh
# ~/.config/lf/lfrc

set shell fish
set shellopts '-eu'

# make sure trash folder exists
%mkdir -p ~/.trash

# move current file or selected files to trash folder
cmd trash %set -f; mv $fx ~/.local/share/Trash/files

# leave some space at the top and the bottom of the screen
set scrolloff 10

# compress current file or selected files with zip
cmd zip ${{
    set -f
    mkdir $1
    cp -r $fx $1
    zip -r $1.zip $1
    rm -rf $1
}}
```

The example file can be found in `/usr/share/doc/lf/lfrc.example` or the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/blob/master/etc/lfrc.example).

## Previewing files

`lf` support a "previewer" script that would run each time we hover on a file.
You can optionally use the [shebang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>)
to interpret the file with a shell.

Just to know the cleaner would run before each preview, just if the previous
previewer end with an error code. For images, we would need to force it.

### Thumbnails

We need a "thumbnail" for some files. We don't need to fully understand the
Free Desktop thumbnail [spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/thumbnail-spec-latest.html#THUMBSAVE)
but you may want to take a look.

```fish
set thumbnail (printf "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails/large/%s.png" (echo -n "file://$argv[1]"| md5sum| awk '{print $1}'))
```

I'm not following the full spec, but it "Good enough".

### Using Kitty icat

This can be a little of a pain to debug, but we can use the `lf -debug` flag to
help us with that.

To understand how to accept the arguments in our script, it would depend on
the shell we are using. We get 5 arguments from `lf`.

```bash
$1 # file
$2 # width
$3 # height
$4 # left
$5 # top
```

So we can "mock" the "previewer" script like this.

### Using kitty

**previewer**

```fish
#!/usr/bin/env fish

mkdir -p $XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails/large/

# with kitty icat
function preview_image
    kitty +kitten icat --stdin no --transfer-mode file --place {$argv[2]}x{$argv[3]}@{$argv[4]}x{$argv[5]} $argv[1] >/dev/tty
    exit 1
end

switch (file --dereference --brief --mime-type $argv[1])
    case "audio/flac"
        if test ! -f $thumbnail; metaflac --export-picture-to=$thumbnail $argv[1]; end
        preview_image $thumbnail $argv[2] $argv[3] $argv[4] $argv[5]

    case "application/x-tar"
        tar tf $argv[1]

    case "application/zip"
        unzip -l $argv[1]

    case "video/*"
        if test ! -f $thumbnail; ffmpeg -i $argv[1] -vframes 1 $thumbnail; end
        preview_image $thumbnail $argv[2] $argv[3] $argv[4] $argv[5]

    case "image/*"
        preview_image $argv

    case "*"
        bat -p -f $argv[1]
end
```

**cleaner**

```fish
#!/usr/bin/env fish

kitty +kitten icat --clear --stdin no --silent --transfer-mode file </dev/null >/dev/tty
```

```fish
# ~/.config/lf/lfrc

set cleaner ~/.config/lf/cleaner
set previewer ~/.config/lf/previewer
```

## Nix & NixOS

lf can be install by incluid it into the `systemPackages` in our NixOS config.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  environment.systemPackages = [
    pkgs.lf
  ];
}
```

Or we can use the `home-manager`
[module](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/master/modules/programs/lf.nix).

```nix
{ pkgs, config, ... }:

{
  programs.lf = {
    enable = true;

    settings = {
      preview = true;
      hidden = true;
    };

    extraConfig =
    let
      previewer =
        pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "previewer.fish" ''
            # our previewer...
      '';

      cleaner = pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "cleaner.fish" ''
            # cleaner ...
      '';
    in
    ''
      set cleaner ${cleaner}/bin/cleaner.fish
      set previewer ${previewer}/bin/previewer.fish
    '';
  };
}
```

### with xdg.configFile

I'm not using the `home-manager` module for configuration, instead I'm using
`xdg.config` to manage my dotfiles.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  home.packages = with pkgs; [ lf ];
  xdg.configFile."lf/" = { source = ./config; recursive = true; };
}
```
