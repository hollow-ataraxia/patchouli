I will say the NixOS installation process is actually quite simple.  
Whether you boot the Graphical or the Minimal ISO, the process doesn't
take too much.

If we download the graphical image, it contains the **graphical NixOS
installer**. For users who want to partition their disk with a graphical
app, they can use [GParted](https://gparted.org/), which's already in the
graphical ISO. Although my recommendation for those who just want to
install NixOS, it's to go directly to the **graphical NixOS installer**.

**Note**: since the graphical installer is very most much the same as
install any other distro that use the [calamares installer](https://github.com/calamares/calamares).
I'm going to cover just the minimal ISO.

## Booting the minimal ISO

![NixOS minimal](/chronicles/nixos-install/NixOS_minimal_tty)

As we can read in shell's greeting, the NixOS manual would be our
primarily resource for the installation.

First, we would need to connect to the internet. Here is when most people
give up, and boot a graphical ISO, with networkmanager, so they can use
`nmtui` to set up internet. I'll say if, you have way too many issues
setting up internet on the minimal ISO, yes you can boot the graphical
Environment, connect to network and then open a terminal and continue with
the installation.

What the NixOS manual tell us, is to use wpa_supplicant. It is the same as when we install
another distros for "advance" users, so if you had previously set up the wireless network on
any of those distros, it doesn't go to take you any time.

### Using wpa_passphrase

```sh
wpa_passphrase ESSID | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

By running `wpa_passphrase` we can get wpa_supplicant configuration.  
Then enter your password and restart wpa_supplicant.

**Note**: To get the ESSID (Extended Service Set Identifier) run `iw dev`.

```sh
sudo iw dev | grep Interface
  Interface # wlp2s0, wlp12s0, wlan0..

# replace interface with your device
sudo iw dev `interface` scan | grep SSID

wpa_passphrase ESSID | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
#reading_passphrase from stdin
network={
  ssid="ESSID"
  #psk="PASSPHRASE"
  psk=dd34ad23098d17da4a43fb886126a6702172563b8e1daad3d102a9c0f8ce18f7
}

sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant.service
```

### Using wpa_cli

For most home networks, you need to type in the following commands:

```sh

> add_network
0
> set_network 0 ssid "myhomenetwork"
OK
> set_network 0 psk "mypassword"
OK
> set_network 0 key_mgmt WPA-PSK
OK
> enable_network 0
OK
```

## Partitioning

Now we go to use cfdisk to partitioned the disk.
For UEFI systems, select the GPT(GUID_Partition_Table) label.

![cfdisk](/chronicles/nixos-install/cfdisk)

After partitioned the disk, we need to format the partitions and put a label.

```shell
sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 -n NIX_BOOT /dev/diskX
sudo mkfs.btrfs -L NIX_ROOT /dev/diskX
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/NIX_ROOT /mnt
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/NIX_BOOT /mnt/boot
```

### hardware-configuration.nix

```nix
{
  fileSystems = {
    "/" = {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-label/apocrypha";
      fsType = "btrfs";
      options = [ "subvol=@" "defaults" "noatime" "compress=zstd" "commit=120" ];
    };

    "/nix" = {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-label/apocrypha";
      fsType = "btrfs";
      options = [ "subvol=@nix" "defaults" "noatime" "compress=zstd" "commit=120" ];
    };

    "/home" = {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-label/apocrypha";
      fsType = "btrfs";
      options = [ "subvol=@home" "defaults" "noatime" "compress=zstd" "commit=120" ];
    };

    "/tmp" = {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-label/apocrypha";
      fsType = "btrfs";
      options = [ "subvol=@tmp" "defaults" "noatime" "compress=zstd" "commit=120" ];
    };

    "/boot" = {
      device = "/dev/disk/by-label/BOOT";
      fsType = "vfat";
    };
  };

  swapDevices = [ ];
}
```

![lsblk output](/chronicles/nixos-install/lsblk)

I don't have memory swap, but my recommendation if you have a btrfs partition is to
make a **swapfile**.

```sh
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/.swapfile bs=1G count=4 # (4GB size)
sudo chmod 600 /mnt/.swapfile
sudo mkswap /mnt/.swapfile
sudo swapon /mnt/.swapfile
```

## NixOS configuration

Run **sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt** to generate a configuration
file in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix and a hardware-configuration module.

We can also have our config in a `nix flake`. I want to cover nix flakes
in a future article. Here I would just give some recommendation.

### nix.settings

Add the nix-command and flake to `nix.settings.experimental-features`, so
you can start using nix 2.0 and flake.

Set `nix.settings.use-xdg-base-directories` to true, so when you use
`nix 2.0` it would follow [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)

```nix
{
  nix.settings = {
    experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
    use-xdg-base-directories = true;
  };
}
```

### networking.networkmanager

Enabling network manager it the easiest way to set up internet once we have
install NixOS. It may be required by some desktop environments, too.

```nix
{
  networking.networkmanager.enable = true;
}
```

### openssh

Be careful with the service openssh , if you don't gonna need it, disable
some options.

```nix
{
  services.openssh = {
    enable = true;
    settings = {
      X11Forwarding = false;
      PasswordAuthentication = false;
      PermitRootLogin = "no";
    };
  };
}
```

### initialHashedPassword

Set a hashed password for the user, this is optional and not always recommended.
What most people would do is to log in into the root and set a password for the
user with `passwd`. With the `users.users.<name>.initialHashedPassword` option
the users' password will be secure by a hash. If `users.mutableUsers` is true,
then after we log in, we can change the password.

**note**: to generate a hashed password run `mkpasswd`.

## nixos-install

After the configuration is done run `sudo nixos-install` in a shell to start the
installation process or `nixos-rebuild switch` if your configuration is in a flake.

```sh
sudo nixos-install --flake .#hostname
```
