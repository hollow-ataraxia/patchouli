# Good for health, bad for...

I'm a software engineer and FOSS advocate.  
Some years ago a friend of my told about a "really cool" framework call
Angular 2. That how I learned TypeScript.
Back then, I was really into xmonad a dynamic window manager for the X Window System.
Looking into the many frameworks, ReactJS was the one with most of the good stuff of
functional-programming, that I like.

My first computer was an IBM ThinkPad A31.
I can't remember which exactly OS, but I guess it was Debian.
Since then, I've been using Linux, not just Debian but openSUSE, void and Arch
Linux, too.

In 2020, I started to daily drive NixOS after seen many developers using it.
I'm still learning, and I like to share my journey of been a web developer
using FOSS.

You can find me working with React, Next.js, Remix, and Astro.

I write about NixOS, Arch Linux and web development.

**tl;dr:** Monads.

### Stuff I'm doing right now
